Bara Shigri Glacier<
The largest  glacier in the   district is situated in Lahaul sub-division known   as Bara Shigri, Bara meaning   big andShigri meaning  glacier, in Lahaul   dialect. Many mountaineers  have trekked  it for the sake of hobby orgeographical exploration. This   glacier rises from a number of large glaciers, meeting in great valley   above, filling that up, and then pushing themselves over its rim in one   great ice-stream down to the river.

Hugh Whistler, writing  in 1924, says, “Shigri is applied par-excellence to  one  particular glacier that emerges from the mountains on the left bank   of the Chandra. It is said to be several miles long, and the snout   reaches right down to the river, lying athwart the customary road from   Kullu to Spiti.” Estimates differ as to the breadth of the glacier where   it is crossed, as owing to its movement and roughness no two caravans   cross it in exactly the same way, but it is not less than a mile wide.   In 1836 this glacier burst its bounds and dammed the Chandra, causing   the formation of a large lake, which finally broke loose and carried   devastation down the valley. The story runs that the people of Spiti   posted guards in the Kunzam Pass to watch whether the water would rise   high enough to flow across into Spiti.”

The Bara Shigri  glacier attracted much attention for many years because  of the  valuable antimony deposits found there. The glacier was first   surveyed in 1906 by H. Walker and E.H. Pascoe of the Geologiaal Survey   of India. Daring 1955 the Geological Survey of India sponsored an   expedition to this glacier as part of the Indian programme for the   International Geophysical Year 1956-57, when a number of Himalayan   glaciers were examined and their snout position fixed.
The Bara  Shigri glacier, whose name signifies ’boulder-covered-ice’,  flows  northwards and debouches into the Chandra river where its   southerly course is deflected westwards, close to the Spiti border. The   glacier is above 3,950 m altitude and extends beyond 4,570 m, a 11 km   length of which has been recently surveyed and mapped. The glacier is so   heavily covered with surface moraine that ice is not visible for long   stretches except along the crevices and in the ablation areas.
Across  the Bara Shigri is another glacier known as Chhota   Shigri. It is a comparatively smaller glacier and does not reach   down to the bed of the river, but it is most steep and slippery,   difficult to cross.

Gangstang Glacier
The  Gangstang glacier situated at the western border of the Lahaul   region at an altitude of about 5,480 m streaming into Shahsha   nullah which joins the Chandrabhaga river at   about 13 km to the south.

Sonapani Glacier
The  desiccated glacier lake and the old terminal moraine are  visible from  the Rohtang Pass. The desiccated lake, about 2.5 km  in length, is a  narrow meandering plain following the contours of  bounding  slopes and consists of such  fluvio-glacial deposits as mud,  fine  sand, pebbles and angular gravels, through which the glacier stream   runs. The glacier is about 11 km long.   An ice-cliff forms the snout which is mostly   covered by stone, and the stream issues from   an ice cave situated towards the western limb of the curved ice-cliff.   To the south of the  snout, and near to  it, is a small terminal moraine. A large terminal  moraine used to  hold up the waters of the old lake. Three more old  terminal  moraines are cut through by the Sonapani stream after its  escape  from the lake-bed.

Perad Glacier
It is a small one and is easily accessible  being within one  kilometre of Putiruni. There is a well marked ice-cave  and the  glacier stream runs between two large lateral moraines.
