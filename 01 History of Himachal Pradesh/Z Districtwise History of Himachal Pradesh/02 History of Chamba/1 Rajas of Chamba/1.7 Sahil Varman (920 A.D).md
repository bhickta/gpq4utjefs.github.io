* Once the Raja accompanied by one of the Yogis named Charpatnath (one of 84 Yogis who visited Raja Sahila Varman), the queen and the princess Champavati after conquering the lower portion of the Ravi valley halted on the plateau on which the present Chamba town is situated.
Champavati revealed her liking for the place and asked her father Sahila Varman to found a town at that place and make it the capital of his State.
The town was subsequently founded around 930 A.D. and named as Champa after the name of his daughter Champavati.
Another legend is that Chamba might have derived its name from the Champa trees which are found in and around the town. Right from the foundation of the town in 930 A.D. it has uninterruptedly been the seat of the government.
Sahila Varman defeated the king of Trigarta or Kangra. When he returned home as a victorious king, the people of Chamba welcomed him with sheaves of maize and rice to greet him. From that day celebration of Minjar fair was started. He started Minjar fair with pomp and show.
