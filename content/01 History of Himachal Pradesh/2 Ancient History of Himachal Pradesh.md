## 2 Ancient History of Himachal Pradesh
0 A2.1 PREHISTORIC AND VEDIC PERIOD
(I) Pre-historic Himachal: Inscription was not developed in pre-historical times. We have not received any written
documents of human beings at this time. _We were only dependent on archaeological resources for this period.
This period is divided into the period of Palaeolithic period (30 Lakh to 10 thousand BC), Mid-Paleolithic
period (1000 BC-4000 BC) and Neolithic period (7000 BC- 1000 BC).
The Proto-historic is called the period, in which the script was there, but it has not yet been read, such as the
Harappan period.
(1) Paleolithic Source: In the 1951, Olaf Prufer has been found in stone pots like Khurpa etc., in Nalagarh on
the right side of Sirsa river, tributary of Sutlej. In 1955 B.B. Lal received samples of instruments of 72 stones
of Adisohan type from Guler, Dehra, Dhaliara and Kangra. Among them mains are Chopper, Hast Kuthar
and Vedani. Dr. G.C.Mahapatra also got the remains of stones made of stone in the Sirsa river valley _and
North Paharan period (3 million-4 lakh years ago) in Kangra. Remains of this period have been received in
1974 in the Suketi area of Markanda River of Sfrmaur.
(2) Mid-Paleolithic and Neolithic Sources: This period (10000 BC-lO00BC) has been considered as one in
India, whereas it is divided into Europe. The origins of sustainable agriculture and civilizations took place
during this period. The evidence of the Neolithic era is found in Kotla-Nihong in Ropar. In the foothills of
the Saraswati-Yamuna rivers, brown paintings are made in.pottery.
(3) Proto-History (at the time of Indus Civilization) Resident of Himachal
• Kol : Kol is native to Himachal Pradesh, which laid the foundation of the new stone age culture. The
people of Koli, Hali, Doom, Chana}, Badhi, etc. of the present in the Western Himalayas are from Kol
caste. Kol tribe finds the settlement in Himachal Pradesh with the rocks of Chandeshwar valley in
Kumaun.
• Kirat: Kirat (Mango}) was·the second caste to come here after the Kol caste. Rishi Vasishtha has called
him 'Shishna Dev' (who worshiped 'Linga' Goddess). In the Mahabharata Kirat has been described as
the resident of the_ Himalayas. In chapter 140 of the Van Parva (Mahabharata), the description of his
residence is found. The Khash were the people who drive them from the mountain foothills to the high
mountains. Manu also described the Kirato. Kinnnar get mention in Raghuvansh of Kiladas .
• Naag: People of this caste lived everywhere in the hills of Himachal. There are 10 feet high statues
of serpents in the Panchvaktra Shiva temple of Mandi. Serpent gods have been shown in the seals of
Harappa civilization. In the Mahabharata, Arjuna had Gandharva married· from the Nag Kanya, the
Naag King Vasuki ofUlupi. Vasu]4 Nag is worshiped in Chamba, Kullu etc. Takshaka Naag established
the Naga state in the Himalayas.
• Khas : The third branch of the Aryans1 which spread from Central Asia through Kashmir to the entire
Himalayas, is called the Khash caste. His residence is found in a village named Khaskandi, Khasdhar
in Rohnu region. The Bhunda festival is celebrated as the victory of the Khaso over the Naga caste, in
which the sacrifice of a family of people belonging to the 'Beda c~ste' who are considered descendants
of the Naga caste is performed. The 'Budhi Diwali' celebrated by the Khaso in Nirmand is also a symbol
of their victory over the primitive castes here. In this, the Khas-Nag war is staged. The Kanait (Kulind)
people descended from the ~ash caste are known as Khasia. This caste is mentioned repeatedly in the
Mahabharata. These people also fought the M~abharata war on behalf of the Kauravas. Descriptions
of Khas have also come in Vayu Purana and Vi~hnu Purana. The warlords of these Khas people later
formed small state associations which were called 'Mavanas'. The Khaso also adopted the polyandry
system like the ancient castes. The Pandavas had also taken the practice of polyandry during exile.
(4) Ancient Gods
• Shiv : Evidence of w orship of such a deity is found by the residents of Himachal, who resemble Shiva.
An example qf this is the temple of Manimahesh, Kinnar Kailash, Mahasu Devta. The oldest religion of
Himachal is Shaivism. Evidence of worship of Pashupat_i Devta is found in the Indus Valley Civilization.
• Shakti : In Himachal Pradesh, Shiva worship was accompi:lllied by Shakti Puja. It became famous in
the mythological names such as Durga, Kali, Amba and Parvati. Shakti Devi in Chhatrari, Lakshana
Devi in Bharmour, Brajeshwari Devi Temple, Jwalamukhi, Hedimba Devi Kullu, _Naina Devi Bilaspur,
Hateshwari Devi Hatkoti and Bhimakali Sarahan are ancient evidence of Shakti worship in Himachal
Pradesh.
4 General Knowledge (Himachal Pradesh)
• Naag Devta : Ancient evidence of many temples and places of worship of Nag Devta has been found
in Himachal Pradesh.
(5) Aryans and Himachal : Aryans have entered into a branch of Central India through Central Asia. These are
called Vedic Aryans. These people brought their livestock, deities and household goods and went towards
the narrow kingdom of Sindhu. They took 400 years to complete their settlement. Vedic Aryans face the
people of the ancient inhabitants of Kol, Kirat and Naga castes, after the Sapta from Sindhu (Punjab) to
Shivalik.
• Sambar-Devodas War : Dasu king "Sambar" had 99 forts in the hills between Yamuna to Beas river.
According to the Rigveda, there was a 40-years war between the Dasyu king Sambar and the Arya king
Devodas. In the end, Devodas killed Sambar at a place called Udvraj. The Aryans forced Kol, Kiratas
and Nagas to move from the lower valleys to the inaccessible hills. Rishi Bharadwaj was the chief
advisor to the Arya king Devodas.
• Khas and Arya: The Aryans also pushed Khas to the inaccessible hills, which sett).ed there, the Aryans
merged them into their own or made slaves.
(II) Vedic period
(1) Vedic Arya : Yayati, the powerful King of the Vedic Arya, laid the foundations of his kingdom on the banks
of the Saraswati river. After that his son 'Puru' became the ruler of this kingdom. ·
• Dashrag War : According to the Rigveda, the battle of Sudas, the son of Devodas, happened between
ten Arya and Anarya King, which is called Dashragya war: Sudas' s army was led by his master and
Minister (Mantri) Vashishtha while Vishwamitra led the armies of the other ten kings. The army of
Sudas defeated the army of ten kings (Puru State). After this Sudas became the most powerful king of
the Rig Vedic period. This war happened along the river Ravi.
(2) Vedic Rishi: Vedic Rishi are connected to the Vasishtha, from Vedic Rishi, from Beas Rishi, Bilaspur to
Beas Rishi, Narmand to Parashurama, Manali to Manu Rishi and Vashishtha Kund hot water chashrne near
Manikaran in Kullu valley. .
• Jamadagni Rishi: Jamadagni Rishi is worshiped in the village of Malana in the form of Jamlu Qeity.
The place where the Jamadagni rishi resided was called the 'Jamu dune (Jamu ka Tibba)'. It is located
near Renuka of Sirmaur district. Renuka was the wife of Rishi Jamadagni. The temple of Parashuram,
son of Jamadagni Maharshi, is located near Renuka Lake. Agastya and Gautama Rishis also made their
own ashram around Renuka and later went to other places to reside.
• Rishi Parashuram : Vedic Arya King Sahastrarjun (Kartavirya) when he reached Renuka, he was
welcomed by .the Jamadagni Rishi. Sahastrarjun demanded 'Kamdhenu' cow from Jamadagni Rishi,
which the rishi refused to give. Being angry at this, he destroyed J amadagni Rishi' s ashram and robbed
his cows. Parashuram organized a local union of the kings and castes and attacked Sahastrarjun and
killed him. Sahastrarjun's sons killed Jamadagni Rishi. From this, Parashurarn got burnt and attacked
all the Kshatriyas. .
(3) Mahabharata Period and Four Ancient Districts of Himachal Pradesh : Himachal is called 'Himvant'
in the Rigveda. In the Mahabharata, the Pandavas had spent time in unknown hills in the upper hills of
Himachal. Bhimsen married Hidimba, the deity of Kullu during his exile. Trigarta· king Susharma fought
on be~alf of the Kauravas in the Mahabharata war. The rulers of Kashmir, Audumbar and Trigarta gave taz
to Yudhishthira. The Kulind Princely State accepted the subjection of the Pandavas. In the Mahabharata,
description of 4 districts - Trigarta, Audumbar, Kulind and Kulu!a is found.
• Audumbars : According to Mahabharata: Audumbars- were the descend~t of sage Vishwamitra
whr,, funded the Gotra of the 'Kaushik' group. Aadumbar State Coins have been found in the areas of
Kangra, Pathankot, Jwalamukhi, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur confirming their habitat. These people
used to worship Shiva. The description of Aadumbar caste is also found in Panini 'Ganpath'. Due to
the plurality of Adumbar tree, this district is called Aadumbar. The word 'Mahadevasa' is found on
the coins of Aadumbars in Brahmi and Kharosthi script which symbolize 'Mahadev'. Trident is also
inscribed on coins. The Aadumbars carried copper and silver coins. Aadumbar was a devotee of Shiva
and a sheepman who may have had connections with the Gaddi tribe of Charnba.
• Trigarta : Trigarta distri~t was founded by Bhumichand. Susharma was the 231st King of his generation.
_Susharam Chandra assisted the Kauravas in the Mahabharata war. Sushararn Chandra attacked the .
P~dava~, who had ~heltered ~ -the unknown, the Matasya ki,ng 'Viraat' (Hattkoti), which was its
ne~ghbonng state. Tngarta, Ravi was part of the river between Beas and Sutlej. Susharam Chandra
bmlt Kangra fort and made Nagarkot his capital. Kanishka described the six state groups as part of
History of Himachal Pradesh 5
the Trigarta. Kauravas Shakti, Jalmani, Janki, Brahrnagupta, Dandki and Kaundoparastha were parts
of the Trigarta. Panini has called Trigarta as an Aayudhjivi Sangh, which means the Sangh living with
the help of war. Trigarta has also been mentioned in Panini's Ashtadhyayi, Rajatarangini of Kalhan,
Vishnu Purana~ Brihat Samhita and Mahabharata's Dronaparva.
• Kulluta : The Kulluta kingdom was the upper bank of river Beas, whose description is found in the
Ramayana, Mahabharata, Vrihatsamhita, Markandeya Purana, Mudrarakshas and Matsya Purana. Its
ancient capital was 'Naggar', which is found in Panini's 'Katreyadi Ganga'. The oldest coinage in the
Kullu Valley is -known as Raja Viyars from 100 AD. It has been written in 'Prakrit' and 'Kharosthi'
languages. The princely state of Kulluta was founded by 'Vihangmani Pal' from Prayag (Allahabad).
• Kulindas : According to Kulind-Mahabharata, Arjuna conquered Kulind. The Kulind Pri.J;lcely State
was the land between Beas, Sutlej and Yamuna covering the areas of Sirmaur, Shimla, Ambala in plains.
The "Kunayat" or "Kanayat" of the present day is believed to be related to Kulind. The name of King
'Amoghbhuti' has been inscribed on the silver coin of Kulind. The mythical name of river Yamuna is
'Kalindi' and the area along with it is called Kulind. Due to the abundance of 'Kulind' (Behera) trees that
grow in this region, this district must have been named Kulind. In the Mahabharata, Arjuna conquered
the Kulindas. Kulind Raja Subahu presented gifts to Yudhishthira in the Rajasuya Yagna. Kulindas
have got the 'Bhagavata Chatreshwar Mahatman' posture of the second century. The Kulindas had
a 'republican system of governance'. The Kulindas, along with the Punjab warriors and Arjunayan,
succeeded in driving away the Kushanas.

History of Himachal Pradesh
0 A2.3 GUPTA PERIOD
Chandragupta-I, the grandson of Shrigupta, laid the foundation of the Gupta Empire in 319 AD. Napoleon
'Samudragupta' of India conquered the mountainous districts in 340 AD and took control of them. The Allahabad
(Prayag) commendation of Harishen mentions the conquest of Samudragupta over the districts of 'Bhadra,
Trigarta, Audumbar, Kullut and Kartikpur. All the kings accepted his subjugation and made him like a Jagirdar.
Kulind district is not mentioned in it. He may have come under the Gupta Empire at the time of Chandragupta-I.
Samudragupta confessed his sovereignty to the hill districts and granted him the freedom to maintain internal
freedom, power and security.
Skandagupta, the son of Kumar Gupta defeated the Huns and maintained the prestige of the Gupta empire. After
