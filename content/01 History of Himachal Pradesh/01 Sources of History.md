(ii) Coins : The task of discovering coins in Himachal Pradesh began to catch momentum after the e~tablishment of
Himachal Pradesh state museum. Coins of Trigarta, Audumbar, Kt~luta and Kunind dynasties have been kept
in Bhuri Singh Museum and State Museum.Shimla. 12 coins kept in Shimla State Museum ha\ ! been received
from Arki. 21 coins of Apollodotus have been obtained from the village of Tappameva of Hamirpur. Some of
Inda-Greek coins have been received from Lachodi and Sarol of Chamba. The oldest coin of Kutlu was run by
Raj Viryasa in the first century. · . .
(iii) Inscriptions/famrapatra manuscript on copper plate : We can get information about the socio-:economic
activities of Himachal Pradesh in ancient times by the inscriptions of the Pathiar and Kanihara of Kangra,
the cave of Sunpur at Hatkoti, the Salonu of Mandi. 36 re~ords have been kept from Chamba in Bhuri Singh
Museum Chamba which are written in Sharda and Tankari scripts. The information of the Guptas is obtained
from the Shalam records of Kullu. Ashoka' s inscription is located in the J aunsar-Bawar area on the confluence of
the Tons and the Yamuna River. Nirmand has .an inscription ofSamudrasen, a seventh-century Mahasamanta.
(iv) Buildings : We also get to know the history of ancient Himachal from the buildings of the Kangra Fort of
H~~al Pradesh, the temples of Bharmour, the rums of Sirmauri Tal, the Buddhist viharas of Kamru, Naggar,
Tabo~d 'Ki'.
(v) Genealogies : Moorcraft worked primarily on genealogy guides, and helped find the genealogies of the kings
of Kangra. C~ptain Harcourt obtained the genealogy of Kullu. Later Cunnirtgham searched the genealogy of
the kings of Kangra, Chamba, Mandi, Suket and Nurpur.
(vi) Travelogue: The most archaic description of Himachal Pradesh is made by Ptolemy in which the description
of Kulindas is given. Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang remained in India till 630-644 AD. During this time he also
came to Kullu and Trigarta. Thomas Coryat and William Finch traveled to Himachal Pradesh during Jahangir.
Forster in 1783, William Moorecraft in 1820-1822, Major Archer in the 1829 travelogues wrote about Himachal.
Apart from this, Alberuni (1030) has described this area (with Mahmud Ghaznavi).
