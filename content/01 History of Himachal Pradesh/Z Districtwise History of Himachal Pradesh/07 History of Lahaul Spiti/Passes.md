| Chaksachan la                    | 5250 m  | A pass between the bend of the Lingti  river in eastern Spiti. From west to east it leads to Lingti valley as  the river makes a curve. Great view of Gyagar from its top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Ghunsarang la                    | 5500 m  | An alternate pass near Manirang Pass is  Ghinsarang la, or known locally as Ghulla la. It also connects Mane with  Ropa by a detour on the same ridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Kuli la                          | 4880 m  | Pass south of Chaksachan la, west of the  Lingti river. It joins the Lingti valley with the Syrma valley in  eastern Spiti.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Kunzum la                        | 4550 m  | This pass is the gate to the Spiti valley  from the west. There is a motorable road running through this pass now,  which connects Batal in the upper Chandra valley and the first village  Losar of the Spiti valley. This pass is broad and easily crossable. The  ascent is steep, but not difficult from the upper Chandra valley, but  the descent towards Spiti valley is negligible. This pass is crossable  on foot from May/June to October/November and the snowfall on this pass  is less than on the Rohtang Pass. The entire route is generally  motorable from early August to late September, depending on snowfall  each year.                                                                                                        |
| Lepcha la Pass or Hangrang Pass  |         | Lepcha la connects the extreme  south­eastern end of the Spiti valley with Shailkhar and Chango of the  Hangrang valley in Kinnaur. There is vegetation on this pass and small  trees and bushes are present. During winter there is residuary snow for  a couple of months but the pass can be negotiated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Manirang  Pass                   | 5550 m  | Manirang  Pass connects the Spiti valley with the Ropa valley of Kinnaur. This is  a high pass and there is a five km long snow-bed on the Ropa valley side  and about a three kilometres long snow-bed on the Spiti side. The  approach to this pass from the Spiti side through village Mane is  gradual whereas the descent towards the Ropa valley side is very steep  through a very narrow gorge.There is  hardly any other traffic on this route. The tracks leading to the pass  are in a bad shape, quite tiring and in some places dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| North  Ratang Col                | 5600 m  | Situated  on the shoulder of Ratang Tower peak. it is approached from the side  valley of the Ratang and on the north leads to the Gyundi valley after  careful negotiation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Parang la                        | 5580 m  | Parang la connects the Spiti valley to parts of Ladakh. On the  Spitian side of this pass, flows the river Parilungbi and the track  runs on its side, climbing up the pass towards Ladakh. There is a  glacier about three kilometres on the northeast of this pass and a  number of crevasses make it difficult to cross. On  the same axis as Parang la lies Takling la which follows a little  detour to cross from Spiti to Ladakh to meet the Parang la route.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Pin  Parvati Pass                | 5400 m  | This is  the only major pass which was not discovered by the enterprising locals.  It was Louis Dane who investigated this pass and finally crossed it in  1897. This is a major pass which links the Pin valley with the Parvati  valley of Kullu, thus avoiding the entire round-about journey over the  Rohtang and Kunzun la. For a visit to the large Pin valley it was not  necessary for locals to come via Kaja. Route  from Kullu climbs up gradually over snowfields and descends to the Pin  valley to meet the Tari Khango pass route. The first villages in the Pin  valley of Spiti are Mud and Sagnam.                                                                                                                                 |
| Sanugba  Col                     | 5400 m  | The  Ratang valley, west Spiti has a major side valley called Sanugba. This  pass in the side valley of Ratang leads to the Sanugba valley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
